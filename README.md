Ordering-System
===============

Designed and developed a functional system using Visual Studio 2012 and SQL Server Management Studio 2012

This is a system development project that I have created for my Business Capstone Course for the College of Business.

It started with business requirements gathering to meet the needs of an actual company by providing them with a solution.

Next I performed data analysis, developed a business case, designed the user-interface, provided functional and non-functional requirements, and developed a solution for the project sponsor.
